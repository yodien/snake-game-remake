This document describes the requirements for ....  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of the software application, Snake-game-remake, is to provide an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience for the user. It is inspired by the games \href{https://github.com/mtala3t/Snake-Java-2D-Game}{Snake-Java-2D-game} in that it focuses on the growth of a snake character through consuming objects throughout the in-game environment. The snake will be a dynamic entity that moves automatically with a constant speed, unless it gains the effect from specific items. The player can adjust the direction to left or right. The player has to operate the snake to avoid collision with the walls and barriers in the map, while also collecting the food items in the map to achieve a higher score. In order to improve the complexity of the game, more in-game functions will be provided such as random potions and trap items.
\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of our product is an external entity who is acting as the final reviewer of our game. They are an entity interested in remaking the "snake game" for the general public.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customer is the general public, especially teenagers, who have little leisure time but great interest in video games.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
The game is only intended for use on Java virtual machines run on windows or OS X.
The only input methods allowed are with a cursor (mouse/trackpad) and a keyboard.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
It is assumed that the target demographic has access to traditional computers with a mouse and keyboard.It is assumed that Windows and Mac OS X will be available for both the developers and users of the game.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
Some important functions are absent in this game such as leader board and restart option when game is over. Also, the choices of maps for this game are limited and the original design for the interface is rough and simple. We are going to reconstruct the user interface to enhance user experience. More gaming systems such as utility items will be introduced to the game to improve the complexity of the game. Our game is a lightweight Java game on PC which can be played by all ages especially teenagers. All the additional functions will be implemented in individual Java modules with high cohesion.

    \end{tabular}
	    \end{adjustwidth}
	\end{table}
\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}
The product is designed to be used by those teenagers who enjoy video game experience. As a successful game on Nokia phones in the 1990s, it requires both quick reactions and forethought. Our product will provide improved experience of challenging themselves to get a higher score on the leaderboard. As an open-source project on public Git repository, our code also provides educational support to the developers who are interested in similar projects.

    \item The snake will start moving when the player presses the space button and a sound effect will be played.\\
        \color{red} Rationale: To give the snake entity constant speed. \color{black}
    \item A food item will be generated at a random empty location inside the border of the map after the player pushes the space button to start.\\

    \item After a set time period, a new effect item will be generated on a random empty location on the map until the maximum number of items is reached.\\
        \color{red} Rationale: To generate items for providing effects on the map. \color{black}
    \item When the snake reaches the effect item, the item is removed from the map and the corresponding effect will be applied on the snake; if there is already effect on the snake, it will be replaced with the new one.\\

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
    The renewal period of software and hardware shortens continuously. These changes may make the game no longer playable or run with bugs. Apart from that, many devices do not have a physical keyboard. Users of these devices may not be able to play this game.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
    Snake game is a very classic game that has been implemented in many languages. These products have the same core game rules game but different add-ons. Some of them add multiplayer options in the game. Some others focus on adding more scenarios, game modes or more items. A java based product called "Snake2D" can be used as the prototype of this project. Other products on GitLab can be treated as source of code.
\subsection{New Problems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{current environment}
    Although most of the snake games online are open source projects, there are still many snake games with copyrights. The developing team should be careful not to breach copyright laws.
\subsubsection{existing users}
    Color-blind users may have a hard time identifying the snake and items in the game.
\subsubsection{Limitations in implementation environment}
    The java virtual machine on the local machine of the developing team processes the code slowly. (long processing time).
\subsubsection{problem from "solution"}
    None.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Tasks}
    The plan for the delivery of the project and each member's role in every delivery are covered by the Gantt chart located in the "project schedule" file in the project. The plan for the meeting is covered in "development plan". In the Gantt chart, phase one tasks are in light blue color that shows the developing team will be working on structuring the project. Phase two tasks are in red color that shows the team will be constructing and building tests for the project. Also, there will be changes in requirements in phase two. The final phase tasks are colored in yellow that shows the developing team has completed the coding part of the project and will be in progress in modifying documents and code for the final product.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
    None.\\This project will only be used in the device that supports java.
\subsection{Risks}
    None. As a software product, there is no physical damage to users. However there might be a risk that some users will be addicted to the game.
\subsection{Costs}
    As this project will be available on GitLab, there will be no cost for downloading the game. But in order to play this game, users need a device that supports java and is able to connect a keyboard.
\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
    Instructions will be shown in the game. There is no need for a separate user documentation file to guide users. Users can get training by playing this game.
\subsection{Waiting Room}
	A possible improvement of the original project multiplayer option can be added to the game to let two players compete for food and items. This will make the game more competitive and attractive to the target users of this product. Then, the game only has one music sound that is played throughout the game. Adding more sounds will also improve the user experience.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
    For the multiplayer option, the second snake feature can be introduced into the game interface with different control buttons and color from the first snake. The two snakes will compete on their scores gaining from eating food. They will also compete for items and avoid hitting on each other. For new sounds, they will be selected from online music records that have no copyright. Background music shall differ in different maps.
